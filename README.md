# Ler-Laun-Dry-Services-Official-Website

This repository contains the code for my website. The website is a personal portfolio that showcases my work as a web developer. The website is built using the following technologies:

            👉🏾 HTML
            👉🏾 CSS
            👉🏾 JavaScript
            👉🏾 React
            👉🏾 Next.js
The website is still under development and is not yet hosted on any platform. I am currently working on the following features:

        👉🏾 A blog section
        👉🏾 A contact form

I am always looking for ways to improve my website. If you have any feedback, please feel free to open an issue.
